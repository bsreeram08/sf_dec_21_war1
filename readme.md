# Large Text Search
### This is an implementation to perform a search on a very large text file using JS.
###### The implementation is done using the following approaches.
- Boyer Moore Algorithm | Good Suffix heuristic
- Reading the large text file as stream to avoid loading the whole file in memory.
- At-most 3 spelling mismatches are taken as a case to value the search.
